<h2>Repair of Ruptured Cranial Cruciate Ligament (ACL) by TightRope Ligament Replacement</h2>

<div id="aclcontent"><p>Just as in the human knee, the most critical stabilizing structure in the canine knee is the cranial cruciate ligament (CCL). The primary function of the CCL is to prevent forward thrusting motion and inward rotation of the tibia during weight bearing and to prevent hyper-extension of the knee.</p>
<p>When the CCL is ruptured or partially torn, the abnormal, forward thrusting motion and inward rotation of the tibia during weight bearing results in an unstable, painful knee and ultimately, in debilitating, degenerative arthritic changes in the knee joint.</p>
<p>The newest procedure for repairing a ruptured CCL by ligament replacement is the TightRope Ligament technique. This procedure has been developed by James L. Cook, DVM, PhD, Diplomat of the College of Veterinary Surgeons. This procedure has been proven in over 200 knees and has been shown to be highly effective. <a href="ACLrepair.html">Read More...</a></p></div>

<h2>Laser Therapy</h2>
<div id= "aclcontent">
<p>Where is it beneficial?</p>
<p>Pain Management, Wound Healing, Rehab, Arthritis, Sprains & Spasms, Nerve Injuries, ACL Tears, Neck & Back Pain, and Post Surgery</p>
<p>Pet owners often prefer a progressive, noninvasive therapy to a drug regimen for the treatment of chronic pain. K Laser therapy provides that solution.</p>
<p>Laser therapy can significantly reduce healing time. Traumatic skin injuries and surgical incisions benefit greatly from laser intervention.</p>
<p>Musculoskeletal injuries and orthopedic surgeries often require additional rehabilitation solutions. Laser therapy provides non-invasive remedies for quicker recovery.</p>
 <p>St. Francis Hospital for Animals is proud to introduce K-Laser Class IV laser therapy for your pets.  Its beneficial uses include alleviating chronic pain, accelerating healing and rehabilitation plus much, much more!<a </a href="lasertherapy.html"> Read More</a></p>
